Given ball by ball cricket data, you will be asked to write a python function to compute some statistic.

The ball by ball data is in the following format:

[
{
	"match": "0",
	"home_team": "Mumbai Indians",
	"away_team": "Kolkata Knight Riders",
	"winning_team": "Mumbai Indians",
	"innings": [
		{
			"inning": 0,
			"batting_team": "Mumbai Indians",
			"bowling_team": "Kolkata Knight Riders",
			"overs": [
				{
					"over": 1,
					"balls": [
						{
							"ball": 1,
							"bowler": "Umesh Yadav",
							"batsman": "Rohit Sharma",
							"runs": {
								"batsman": 4,
								"extras": 0,
								"total": 5
							},
							"out": {
								"type": "none",
								"fielder": "none"
							}
						}
					]
				}
			]
		}
	]
}
]

You can use the following functions that are defined elsewhere:

is_player_same_as(player_name)

is_team_same_as(team_name)

While doing the computation, keep track of:
- The number of balls the batsman has faced in the inning
- The number of runs the batsman has scored in the inning

Write a python function to compute how many times Kohli has scored more than 30 runs. Name this function "get_stat()" and it should take exactly one parameter: data. Do not write code to execute the function.

Given ball by ball cricket data, you will be asked to write a python function that does a computation that is described.

The ball by ball data is in the following format:

[
{
   "match": "0",
   "home_team": {
      "name": "Mumbai Indians",
      "players": [
         "Rohit Sharma"
         "Jasprit Bumrah"
      ]
   },
   "away_team": {
      "name": "Kolkata Knight Riders",
      "players": [
         "Shreyas Iyer"
         "Umesh Yadav"
      ]
   },
   "winning_team": "Mumbai Indians",
   "innings": [
      {
         "inning": 0,
         "batting_team": "Mumbai Indians",
         "bowling_team": "Kolkata Knight Riders",
         "overs": [
            {
               "over": 1,
               "balls": [
                  {
                     "ball": 1,
                     "bowler": "Umesh Yadav",
                     "batsman": "Rohit Sharma",
                     "runs": {
                        "batsman": 4,
                        "extras": 0,
                        "total": 5
                     },
                     "out": {
                        "type": "none",
                        "fielder": "none"
                     }
                  }
               ]
            }
         ]
      }
   ]
}
]

---------------------

You can use the following functions that are defined elsewhere:

- is_player_same_as(player_name_1, player_name_2)

- is_team_same_as(team_name_1, team_name_2)

---------------------

Instructions to do some basic computations:

- number of runs scored by a player in an inning can be obtained by summing the runs scored by the batsman in each ball of an inning

- win percentage of a team can be obtained by dividing number of matches played by the team satisfying the given condition by number of matches won by the team satisfying the given condition

- if asked to compute something for the first n balls a player faces, do it for the first n balls of every inning and aggregate the result. You'll have to maintain separate counter to count balls faced in an inning.

- average of a batsman is the number of runs he has scored divided by the number of times he has become out
